Gaia is an ethical stock tracker. The demo and welcome page work best for desktop, but the about page was made to be responsive on mobile as well.

Some things we've learned and implemented for this project are:
   - Responsive Web Design with HTML/CSS
   - Data representation with chart.js
   - API calls with jQuery
   - API Proxy server with node.js, enabling caching and ratelimiting

Thank you for looking at our project!
