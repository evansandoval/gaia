Gaia is an ethical stock tracker named after the Greek goddess of the earth. The trade and welcome page work best on desktop, but the about page was made to be responsive on mobile as well.

Some things we've learned and implemented for this project are:
   - Responsive Web Design with HTML/CSS and JavaScript
   - Data representation with Chart.js
   - API calls with jQuery
   - API Proxy server with node.js for security, caching and ratelimiting

A functional demo of the project can be found at the link below https://gaiatrader.herokuapp.com/

*Note - the ESG API only supports 50 calls per day for free, so it may start getting glitchy past that.

Thank you for looking at our project!
