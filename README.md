Gaia is an ethical stock tracker. The trade and welcome page work best for desktop, but the about page was made to be responsive on mobile as well.
A functional demo of the project can be found on https://gaiatrader.herokuapp.com/

*Note - the ESG API only supports 50 calls per day for free, so it may start getting glitchy past that.

Some things we've learned and implemented for this project are:
   - Responsive Web Design with HTML/CSS
   - Data representation with chart.js
   - API calls with jQuery
   - API Proxy server with node.js, enabling caching and ratelimiting

Thank you for looking at our project!
